			<h2>History and Debate of Internet Censorship</h2>
			<p>
				Censorship refers to any action taken by a society to control access to ideas and information. Throughout history, many different types of societies, including democracies, have used censorship in various ways. The issue is increasingly important due to the rapid development of new communication technology. As innovators continue to create new ways for people to share information, many people are now arguing over the issue of censorship. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>

Through this ignorance, citizens are more easily controlled by special interest groups, and groups that are able to take power are able to use censorship to maintain themselves. <a href="#p-4">More</a>

				Another main issue for those who are against censorship is a history of censorship abuse. <a href="#p-5">More</a>. They argue that people should control the government instead of the government controlling its people. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
