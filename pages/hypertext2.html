			<h2>Are Social Networking Sites Good for Our Society?</h2>
			<p>
				74% of American adults online use social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest, as of Jan. 2014, up from 26% in 2008.  On social media sites like these, users may develop biographical profiles, communicate with friends and strangers, do research, and share thoughts, photos, music, links, and more. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>

				Proponents of social networking sites say that the online communities promote increased interaction with friends and family; offer teachers, librarians, and students valuable access to educational support and materials; facilitate social and political change; and disseminate useful information rapidly. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Opponents of social networking say that the sites prevent face-to-face communication; waste time on frivolous activity; alter children’s brains and behavior making them more prone to <span class="vocabulary" title="Attention deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</span>; expose users to predators like pedophiles and burglars; and spread false and potentially dangerous information. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>

			<h3>Specialized opinion</h3>
			<p>
				Companies worldwide struggle to balance employee social network access at work for business purposes. Sophos, a company that develops and sells computer security programs, stated that “Although productivity continues to be the dominant reason for companies to block social networks (a third of companies say this is the reason they block Facebook), there has been a dramatic rise since April 2009 in the number of businesses who believe malware [malicious software] is their primary security concern with such sites.” <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>

			<p>
				The National School Boards Association (NSBA) stated the following: “Almost 60 percent of students who use social networking talk about education topics online and, surprisingly, more than 50 percent talk specifically about schoolwork... <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h2-1">More</a>

				On the opposite side, Himanshu Tyagi, Specialist Registrar in Psychotherapy at the Springfield University Hospital in London, reflects that “It may be possible that young people who have no experience of a world without online societies put less value on their real world identities and can therefore be at risk in their real lives. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h2-2">More</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Still regarding the youngsters, Brendesha M. Tynes, PhD, Assistant Professor of Educational Psychology at the University of Illinois affirms that "Online social networking can facilitate identity exploration, provide social cognitive skills such as perspective taking, and fulfill the need for social support, intimacy, and autonomy. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h2-3">More</a>

			<h3>Public opinion</h3>

				As for regular people who use social networking everyday Raul says "Thanks to Facebook you can talk with your family and your friends who are far. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h2-4">More</a>

				Judy reflects on relationships and believes the following: "I believe that social networking sites aren't good for our society because they don't help us communicate socially in person. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h2-5">More</a>

				Security is also under risk, according to Joan: “Criminals use social media to follow people and get their information about their whereabouts also to promote their crimes. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h2-6">More</a>

				To close the heated debate, Daniel concludes that “The internet provides an equal work space for people of all kinds all over the world. With so much to present there is new competition which will offer more products, consequently more  job opportunities, more choices to users.” <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Proponents of social media cheer on the benefits and possible advances to society, while dissenters worry the dangers and wasted time far outweigh any benefit. Whether it is good or bad, it is up to everyone to define their personal involvement in networking. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
