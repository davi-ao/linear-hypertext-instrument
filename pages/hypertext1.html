			<h2>Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?</h2>
			<p>
				An estimated 26 million animals are used every year in the United States for scientific and commercial testing. Animals are used to develop medical treatments, determine the toxicity of medications, check the safety of products destined for human use, and other biomedical, commercial, and health care uses. Research on living animals has been practiced since at least 500 BC. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Proponents of animal testing say that it has enabled the development of many life-saving treatments for both humans and animals, that there is no alternative method for researching a complete living organism, and that strict regulations prevent the <span class="vocabulary" title="To treat a person or animal badly, cruelly, or unfairly">mistreatment</span> of animals in laboratories. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Opponents of animal testing say that it is cruel and inhumane to experiment on animals, that alternative methods available to researchers can replace animal testing, and that animals are so different from human beings that research on animals often <em>yields</em> irrelevant results. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
			</p>
			<h3>Public opinion</h3>
			<p>
				A public outcry over animal testing and the treatment of animals in general broke out in the United States in the mid-1960s.<i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h1-1">More</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Many animal defenders say that “Animals, like humans can feel emotions. No living creature on this planet should be tested on harmfully, when there are other methods that are more accurate available, even cheaper.” <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Still others complain, saying “If you are opposed to animal testing, you should not use anything that has been tested on animals (even historically). You should not use cleaning products, such as Windex, or Post-it notes, or Band-Aids, or condoms, or M&Ms, or Kleenex, or some pet foods, or Vaseline. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h1-2">More</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Others say that “Animals were put here for a reason. In my opinion, I think that we should use more species of animals to be tested. They are lower on the food chain for a reason. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h1-3">More</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				On the opposite side, Clay defends that animal testing is crueler than eating the animals. The animals that are being butchered aren’t suffering everyday. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h1-4">More</a>

			<h3>Specialized opinion</h3>
			<p>
				Dario L. Ringach, PhD, MSc, Professor of Neurobiology and Psychology at the UCLA stated that “The contributions of animal research to medical science and human health are undeniable... When the majority of scientists see the work as scientifically justified, and so do the many professional medical and scientific organizations, the expert views cannot be simply dismissed based on wild claims of ulterior motives, self-interest and conspiracy theories.” <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Neurologist Aysha Akhtar, MD, MPH, says that “Failures of animal experiments have led to human harm. Moreover, misleading animal experiments may have caused the abandonment of effective drugs and cures.” <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h1-5">More</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				In Defense of Animals (IDA), an international animal rights and rescue organization, stated that “Cutting-edge technology has forged new frontiers with the use of lasers, fiber optics, microchips, genomics, computer-based drug design, and digital imaging, to name a few... <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i> <a href="#h1-6">More</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, the Foundation for Biomedical Research (FBR) stated that “From the discovery of antibiotics, analgesics, anti-depressants, and anesthetics, to the successful development of organ transplants, <span class="vocabulary" title="A medical operation in which the flow of a person's blood is changed to avoid a diseased part of their heart.">bypass surgery</span>, heart catheterization, and joint replacement, practically every present-day protocol for the prevention, control, and cure of disease is based on knowledge attained through research with laboratory animals.” <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
			</p>
			<p>
				While scrutinizing on pros and cons of  animal testing, benefits and costs should be considered in either case. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>

				A farmer’s pet Dalmation that was kidnapped and sold into experimentation is believed to have been the initial catalyst for the rise in anti-testing sentiment. <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>

				Besides, aren’t we just animals that have evolved more than others? Darwinism permits that we should use anything we can to further our species’ survival.” <a href="#h1-3-1">More</a>

				Their pain is short and the death is swift. In Animal Testing, they are tortured everyday and become deformed.” <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>

			<p>
				“One can’t help wonder: how many people would have been saved if we used more effective human-based testing methods?” <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="h1-6" class="hide">
			<p>
				These methods have contributed to a technological revolution in biomedical research and <span class="vocabulary" title="To cause someone or something to be in a particular state.">rendered</span> the reliance on animals outdated.” <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o text-danger"></i>
